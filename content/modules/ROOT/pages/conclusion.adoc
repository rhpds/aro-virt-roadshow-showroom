By completing this lab, you’ve seen how OpenShift Virtualization on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) brings VMs onto a Kubernetes-based platform and sets a clear path from migration to modernization.
You created and migrated VMs with the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (including advanced options and hooks), explored storage fundamentals with PVCs, snapshots, clones, and performed VM-aware backup and restore with OADP.
You also accelerated repeatable provisioning using Templates and InstanceTypes, then executed Day-2 operations by exposing VM-hosted apps through Services and Routes—showing how VM workloads can participate in the same cloud-native workflows as containers.

We hope you have enjoyed {lab_name} and learning more about *OpenShift Virtualization* and how it can be a useful tool for both the import and management of legacy virtual machines, as well as a stepping stone on the path of application modernization.

[key_takeaways]
== Key Takeaways

* OpenShift Virtualization is solution oriented, providing you with a mature, stable, and scalable solution that's easy to get started with.

* OpenShift Virtualization is available at every subscription level of Red Hat OpenShift from OpenShift Platform Plus which provides a full hybrid cloud application development platform, to OpenShift Virtualization Engine, an offering that specializes in providing support for virtualized workloads.

* OpenShift Virtualization is fully integrated with a broad ecosystem of partner products, with more coming on board each day. Check with your preferred hardware and software vendors to see if they support OpenShift Virtualization.

* OpenShift Virtualization can help you set a strong foundation for tradtional workloads, while building skills for the future with a modern application platform.

=== Virtualization Migration Assessment

* A two-week onsite interactive workshop and follow-up report.
* Experienced Red Hat architects run a short series of onsite workshops to help develop your migration journey.
* They provide an extensive review of your virtualization environment and it's current integrations including: networking, storage, security, backup, and disaster recovery.
* You recieve a VMA report with a tailored proposal for your complete migration incluing high-level recommendations and design considerations.
* This can help with understanding of where you're going, how you'll get there, how long it will take, and how much it will cost.
