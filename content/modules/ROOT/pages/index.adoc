== Introduction
Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) provides a clear and practical path for organizations looking to transition from traditional virtualization platforms to a modern, cloud-native application infrastructure.
By bringing virtual machines (VMs) onto a Kubernetes-based foundation, teams can migrate existing workloads with confidence while setting the stage for long-term modernization and innovation.

Built jointly by Red Hat and Microsoft, OpenShift Virtualization on ARO delivers a secure, enterprise-grade platform that unifies the management of virtual machines, containers, and serverless workloads under a single, consistent experience.
With integrated tools like the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) and Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), administrators can streamline migrations, automate ongoing operations, and reduce complexity across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

Running on Azure Red Hat OpenShift, OpenShift Virtualization extends these capabilities with managed services, automated Day 2 operations, and continuous updates that combine Red Hat’s open-source innovation and RHEL expertise with Microsoft’s cloud reliability and scale.
The result is a flexible, secure, and future-ready platform that reduces operational overhead and helps organizations modernize at their own pace.

This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.
You’ll explore common administrative and operational tasks, such as VM creation, migration, automation, and lifecycle management, using the same tools and workflows used in production environments.
By the end of the lab, you’ll understand how OpenShift Virtualization on ARO simplifies VM management, enhances platform efficiency, and provides a foundation for hybrid cloud modernization.

== Who Will Benefit Most from attending a Roadshow?

*Virtual Machine Administrators* -- Those responsible for day to day management of virtual guests in OpenShift Virtualization. These users will often find themselves responsible for provisioning virtual guests, and day to day management of the guests, and the applications running within.

*Virtual Infrastructure Administrators* -- Those responsible for the physical infrastructure hosting the OpenShift Virtualization solution. These users will be responsible for physical hardware, storage, and networking changes to the environment, that will affect the day to day operations of the running virtual machines.

== What Content Is Covered In The Roadshow?

These are the *seven* main sections that will be covered:

* _Virtual Machine Management_: In this section we will provide a review of virtual machine management fundamentals, including creating a virtual machine, and modifying its allotted resources.

* _Migrating Existing Virtual Machines_: In this section, we will use the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) to migrate virtual machines from an existing VMware vSphere environment to OpenShift Virtualization.

* _Storage Management_: The storage paradigm familiar to many administrators changes with OpenShift Virtualization. This section will explore many actions related to storage management for virtual machines.

* _Backup and Recovery for Virtual Machines_: This unit introduces and demonstrates additional concepts around backing up VMs to external sites and restoring them in the event of a disaster.

* _Template and InstanceType Management_: In order to streamline deployment of virtual machines, administrators will often create Templates or define InstanceTypes to ease deployment operations. This section will focus on those processes.

* _Working with Virtual Machines and Applications_: In this section we will perform some day-2 activities with our imported virtual machines, by exposing our VM hosted applications through services and routes.

* _Network Management_: By default VMs are connected to the pod network in OpenShift. In this section we will explore creating new L2 network mappings as well as making use of user defined networks (UDN) for direct network connectivity.

== What is OpenShift Virtualization?

* All current subscribers receive OpenShift Virtualization as part of their OpenShift subscription.
It has been generally available since OpenShift 4.5 was released on Azure Red Hat Openshift with openshift 4.18.
* OpenShift Virtualization is based on the “container-native virtualization” technology being developed upstream under the KubeVirt project, an incubating project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
* It leverages the Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM hypervisor (RHEL KVM), which is a mature and highly performant open-source hypervisor used by many organizations and cloud service providers globally and which has been under development for over 15 years.
* OpenShift Virtualization leverages the RHEL KVM hypervisor and allows the VM to be managed by Kubernetes and KubeVirt.
An OpenShift Virtualization VM uses Kubernetes scheduling, network, and storage infrastructure.

* OpenShift Virtualization is SVVP certified with Microsoft for Windows guest support per the same rules that apply to Red Hat’s other KVM virtualization offerings.
* Openshift Virtualization on Azure is supported on Boost instance types.
For complete list of supported instances, refer to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/howto-create-openshift-virtualization[support page].
* OpenShift Virtualization allows OpenShift to deploy, manage, and connect virtual machines to resources in an OpenShift cluster.
This includes the ability to connect to and manage those VMs using Kubernetes-native methods and take advantage of OpenShift features like Pipelines, GitOps, Service Mesh, and more.

== Why switch from a traditional VM platform?

**Adopt cloud-native development and/or cloud-native operations:**
Azure Red Hat OpenShift helps your team build applications with speed, agility, confidence, and choice.
Code in production mode, anywhere you choose to build.
Get back to doing work that matters.

**Complete app dev stack:**
Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces (formerly Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces), Runtimes, Integration and Process Automation, Serverless, Pipelines, and more with security throughout.

**Shift infrastructure spend to innovation:**
OpenShift native architecture changes the heavyweight cost structure from SDDC legacy to lightweight container-native frameworks.

**Risk mitigation:**
With OpenShift support for on-premises and public cloud options, OpenShift is insurance against public cloud lock-in.

**Independent from infrastructure:**
Red Hat OpenShift runs consistently on bare metal, on-premises virtualization, or public cloud for ultimate choice and flexibility of deployment and updates.

**Pure open source innovation:**
The innovation in Kubernetes, serverless, service mesh, Kubernetes Operators, and more powered by the velocity of open source, with Red Hat in the lead.

== Requirements for the Lab Environment

* Participant needs to have their own computer with a web browser and internet access.
* Chromium based browsers are recommended as some copy/paste functions don't work in Firefox for the time being.
* Remote access console uses the US keyboard layout by default, so it's good to know where special characters reside for other country's layouts, or to use the copy/paste function in a supported browser.

=== Credentials for the OpenShift Console

Your OpenShift cluster console is available {openshift_console_url}[here^].

Your login is available with:

* *User:* {user}
* *Password:* {password}
